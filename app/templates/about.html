  <h1 class="mb-3 text-center">About This Project</h1>
  <p class="lead text-center">This recipe generator was a kind of selfish endeavor, but maybe others would find it useful too!</p>
  <p class="text-center">Each recipe is curated from a personal collection and organized by meal type — breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks.</p>
  <p class="text-center">It randomly pulls a recipe from a Google Sheet every time you click, helping reduce choice paralysis and make meal planning a little more fun!</p>
  <p class="text-muted text-center mt-4">Made with Flask + Bootstrap</p>
